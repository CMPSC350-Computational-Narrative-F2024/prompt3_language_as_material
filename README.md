## Summary

Our exploration of language as a form of data continues to break down the meanings, uses, and understandings we have about what constitutes language tech. In this prompt, we consider what language looks like if it is further reduced and permuted, given strict templates which make language boring, or taken up as a purely visual medium. The approaches reduce language to _just what it is_, a system of signs and symbols that _can_ mean, but doesn't always. This is true, at least, as far as we hold to agreements like syntax, subject/verb relationships, and other normative views of linguistics as a sense toward meaning rather than a set of meanings working toward sense.

Today we further explore the permissionless "meaningspace" of raw data.

## Goals

* Explore pure code as an expressive medium
* Engage with developing "writing machines"

## Outcomes

* 1 poem which engage the idea of language as a material object:
  * the poem **must** engage with only a single letter as a visual form
* Submit 
  * in `/writing` directory, all prompts used -- must try at least three prompts (each modified based on previous output)
  * in `/writing` directory, final generated image
  * in 'src/' directory, modified Python program
